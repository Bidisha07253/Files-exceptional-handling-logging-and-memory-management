        "\n",
        "* A compiled language is converted entirely into machine code before execution, while an interpreted language is translated and executed line-by-line at runtime by another program called an interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "* An exception is an event that occurs during the executing of programs that disrupt teh normal flow of exception\n",
        "\n",
        "* An exceptiom is a runtime error that can be caught and handelled to prevent your program from stopping unexpectedly\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "*The primary purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to ensure that a specific section of code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. It is a critical tool for resource management and cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is logging in Python?\n",
        "* The logging Module in python is a build in tool that lets you track events, error, warnings or information in your program while it runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "* Its main significance is to define cleanup actions that should be performed before the object's memory is reclaimed by the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "* This statement imports the entire module, adding the module name itself to your local namespace. To access any function, class, or variable from that module, you must prefix it with the module's name using dot notation\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "* We can handle multiple exceptions using TRY and Except Block in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "* It will Automatically closes the file when the block ends.\n",
        "* It is cleaner and safer\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "* MultiThreading allows you to run mutliple task at the same time within a single program.\n",
        "* It allows a program to run multiple process in parallel, each with its own python interpreter and separate memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "* Good for Production and debug\n",
        "* You can filter by events\n",
        "* You can enable and disbale log easily\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "* Memory management in Python is the automatic process of allocating and deallocating memory for objects and data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "* The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python are to wrap the code that might cause an error in a try block and then provide one or more except blocks to handle specific exceptions that may be raised. You can also use optional else and finally blocks for additional control flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "* Memory management is important in Python because it directly impacts a program's performance, stability, and resource usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "* Try: statements you want to excecute it.\n",
        "* Except: execute when exception occured in try.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "* Python's garbage collection (GC) system is automatic and primarily relies on two mechanisms that work together: reference counting and a generational garbage collector. This dual approach ensures that memory is efficiently managed and reclaimed, preventing memory leaks, particularly in cases involving circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "* Else block runs if there is no eceptionn occurs.\n",

        "* ERROR\n",
        "* CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "* The key difference between os.fork() and Python's multiprocessing module is that os.fork() is a low-level, operating-system-specific function, while multiprocessing is a high-level, cross-platform library that provides an easy-to-use interface for creating processes. The multiprocessing module often uses os.fork() behind the scenes on Unix-based systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "* Closing a file in Python is crucial for data integrity, resource management, and program stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "* The difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python lies in the amount of data they retrieve from a file and the data type they return.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "* The logging Module in python is a build in tool that lets you track events, error, warnings or information in your program while it runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "* The os module in Python provides a portable way to interact with the operating system, allowing you to perform various file and directory management tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "* The challenges associated with Python's memory management stem from its automatic nature, which, while simplifying development, can lead to complex issues in specific scenarios.\n",

        "* In Python, you manually raise an exception using the raise keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "* Multithreading is important for applications that need to manage multiple independent tasks concurrently, like webscraping, reading multiple files.\n"
